CMOD reference manual

	The FPGA will be mostly to learn more about Verilog and the serial interfaces/DMA
	between the integrated circuits, but the concepts I have researched on how the 
	FPGA can be used is a reassuring sign of things to come for the later stages.
	I mostly would like to speak to professor Radu for her insight as I progress in this 
	area of the project, as the FPGA could also be used to ensure fail-safe procedures of 
	the digital system as well.
