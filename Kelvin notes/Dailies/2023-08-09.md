Forgot to do a daily yesterday, which is okay. Yesterday was fairly easy going, mostly fixing some environment settings in VScode and listening to a podcast on Go Vs Rust, the two languages im most interested in gaining proficiency in long term

Today I did some work on Typescript, learning a little more about objects and the importance of compiling in typescript before javascript. It is exciting to break through this mental block of mine of finding web development intimidating, so im looking forward to continuing this daily expectation of learning so I can better understand how these different components like Mongodb and React play a hand in simplifying the workflow of a full-stack developer.
