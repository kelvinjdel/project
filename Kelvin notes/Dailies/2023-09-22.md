I've been struggling getting consistent momentum, in part due to some medication issues, but one thing I'm trying is to have a menu to ground myself with of certain topics in STEM that interest me and then rolling a d20 to see what I am going to dedicate time into that day

today I got an 8 so I will be practicing Rust for a bit
Then later, a Godot game to branch away from Arcade.Makecode for a Linux game

First fixing some of my windows development settings
- powertoys, powershell preview/terminal preview, with some settings. restarting to fix virtualization, as I had to turn it off for Valorant

worked on some Rust guessing game stuff
