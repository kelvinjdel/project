Going to just focus my energy this week into building Mugu, which is based on an artificer design I've been playing with in DnD. He'll be my little playground with embedded systems for the week* ended up only being Monday, but getting back into it this week with some other projects. It was just a nice kick to explore robotics to play with microcontrollers, and test some PID, networking, and my development environment
