Installed Packet tracer and going to revisit Cisco courses to refresh my understanding of networking to supplement my education from my courses from Farmingdale. 

But Networking is fairly low priority for me, so I don't see myself studying this for a few months compared to what I want to practice with Embedded and Qiskit.
