- I'll probably have to learn some Java for some software development

But for now I can see it working as this. we have 12 inputs and potentially more for the DND aspect. so instead of worrying about using the fpga for hardware acceleration, lets use it to assist in  decoding the inputs;


peripherals-> fpga-> spi-> microcontroller ->  embedded software ->  GUI -> game

- check reference..digilentinc.com; forum.digilentinc.com to talk to other engineers

break; after break back to learning about digilent

So, adafruit might be a really good option. I can use the Adafruit forums and learn more from others

Joined discord server. small things man, but why not :3

genuinely mad excited, I can use things like adafruit to help out as well
