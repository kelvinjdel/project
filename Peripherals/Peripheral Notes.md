	Most likely the final stage of the project. When I feel more comfortable
	with the core of the project, I am excited to explore the possibilities to 
	introduce more complexity to the project. Why stop as single player, or just one 
	joystick/button, or local gameplay, etc. I believe that this stage will be the easiest
	or most comfortable due to the options available should I not be able to make it work,
	but I also believe that there will be alot of electrical engineering to learn which is
	a point of learning that I could benefit more from


#joystick #button 

- Many options for peripheral inputs, not priority for now
	- homemade joysticks/buttons
	- DND "magic box", module if on good pace to build a dice
	 reader, adding increased features for table
	 - 2-6 player "air hockey" game with 6 joysticks/buttons
