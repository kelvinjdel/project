# Arcade Game System K1 (temporary)

## Expectations
- platformer created from [[Microsoft]]'s Makecode system
- raspberry PI or similar
- VGA(640x480) resolution
- 60 Hz refresh rate
- Hardware acceleration using CMOD S7 FPGA
	- controller input logic, graphical acceleration, etc

## Goals
- Incorporates features for a Dungeons and Dragons table
	- machine learning camera that can translate player rolls to send to algorithms
	- Internet/Software integration for editing maps from tools such as Roll20/Talespire
	- Character sheet/API data management
	These examples are very low priority as they are mostly Computer Science based but
	should add alot of depth to my technical skills regardless by putting effort into them

- Multiplayer Arcade Game
	- roguelike 2/3 player survival game
	- co-op platformer
	- 6 player airhockey table
	These are also very hopeful goals, but, as unprofessional as it sounds, I get so excited 
	thinking about spending the next few months putting all of this together to create
	a fun 80s aesthetic airhockey arcade game for my friends, in a manner that should also 
	make me a much more suitable candidate for employment

## Technical ideology
- Ideally, this project will lead me through the thought process of engineering from the
brainstorming to mass production. The final documentation will seek to explain the different methods and research enlisted to provide minimal power consumption, price, and details
including the datasheets, schematics, and PCB for a production team to utilize.
