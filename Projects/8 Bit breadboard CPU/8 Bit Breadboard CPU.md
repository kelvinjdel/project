Followed Ben Eater's Youtube tutorial for building an 8 bit breadboard computer using ICs, an EEPROM programmed with an arduino nano, output module with 7 segment displays, and other circuit components.

The final product consists of a timer module using 555 timers, two 8 bit register modules with an ALU, instruction register, memory and 16 8 bit registers, an output decoder, flag registers, etc.

the computer architecture revolves around the 8 bit bus in the middle, as well as other asynchronous/synchronous components that are triggered depending on the instructions received by the decoder circuit. 

The files I shared in the media folder highlight the different stages of building and debugging
