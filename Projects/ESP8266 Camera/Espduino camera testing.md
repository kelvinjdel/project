I received an OV7670 camera module today, so I'm going to play around with a NodeMCU and see how much I can get done by the end of today.

I'll mostly be following this tutorial, https://www.instructables.com/OV7670-Arduino-Camera-Sensor-Module-Framecapture-T/, and see if I can get it working by tonight along with whatever other additions i'd be interested in testing.

- progress with soldering after second day, 12/11/23

The overall time took about 6 hours for this progress, there are still 4 wires left to put together from the Camera Module, but I have to focus on my Final Thursday before finishing.
