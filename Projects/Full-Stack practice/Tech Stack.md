The course I am trying involves using
Node.Js
Typescript
Mongodb
Postman
React
Redux
Express

I am new to this all so I am not sure what it means necessasrily, but I am excited nonetheless to put my education to the keyboard and have fun with it all

off the bat, one thing I can imagine myself building in conjunction to what Ive learned and will continue to potentially learn is a web browser game that takes in MIDI input. I dont know how this would work, but it would be really fun to try.
