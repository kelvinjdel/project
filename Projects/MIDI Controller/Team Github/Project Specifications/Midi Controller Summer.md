The MIDI controller at its current stage is composed of 5 main components, as shown on the first section, with the second one giving an overview of areas that need to be worked on visualized by a cloud symbol. 

On the right, there are 4 areas that summarize work to be done over the summer. Aron and I will be working on the digital processing side of the project, which should take a few weeks to finetune, and Abdullah and I will be working on the GUI and encoder side of things which should take a week or two.

There is also more we can do with MIDI drums and additional encoders should Omar want to assist me on them, and we should be looking really good entering the fall semester just from these two or three weeks. Ideally, we can integrate a full DAW and synthesizer as well, and potentially get really quick responses for chords and harmonics out of the piezo. 

I will be working on some other projects and see if I can integrate them with this like a simple MIDI game, but I would be more than happy to work on whatever else lights you all up. Look into the fields of engineering technology youre interested in and see if you can find a way to integrate it into the project, so for me personally I will be researching some embedded stuff to optimize the system but I am open to anything as it will be a nice learning process regardless of what it is.
