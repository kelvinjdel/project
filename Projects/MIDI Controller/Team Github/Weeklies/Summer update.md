The team has been mostly resting up ahead of a long semester, and researching on their own this summer, but for this week I wish to lay the foundation of success for the second part of the project. 

I have soldered some circuits to play with including some SD, rechargeable battery power supply, and mp3 players to experiment with using some Node MCUs and Arduino. 
Abdullah and I will be exploring these tests and seeking to integrate them for the MIDI controller

# Portable functionality
- SD cards are necessary for the ability to translate acoustic instruments to predetermined MIDI notes, such as drums or guitar -> piano. They also present an opportunity to get creative with mobility, such as a musician playing with their 


# Speaker functionality
- I am using an adafruit amplifier solution to test audio output with a small 4 ohm speaker. We may not need this in the overall project, but it will be a good intermediary to use to test SD card and mp3 file functionality for different solutions to the controller


Abdullah and I will be integrating his graphical solution and expand on the vision we have for the project
