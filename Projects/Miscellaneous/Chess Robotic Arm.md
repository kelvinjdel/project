This was a semester long project around 2016 I did with a partner in an embedded systems course that won me over in switching to Computer Engineering as a major and career. At the end, we were tasked with writing a C program using libraries to control a robotic arm for a task of our choosing.

I dont have the code nor a video of the final product, but the arm was able to lift up a piece from a close by square of a chessboard (user would input something like E2) and place it down on D4. The final result was fairly inconsistent but was a very fun project to get a young engineer excited about tech

I have videos from this class in the tech pics, as we touched switches(simple testing), then bluetooth connection, then finally controlling the stepper motors of a robotic arm
