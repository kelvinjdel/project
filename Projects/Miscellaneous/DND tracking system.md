This was a fairly simple project to use a 16x2 LCD, an arduino Uno, and an infrared sensor and remote. 
The project was a good practice to put my understandings of data structures to use by setting up an order of Initiative into combat, which tracked things like health and order in combat of each player that "rolled" by the remote control

long term, I want to replace the infrared with a machine learning solution to read dice rolls through a camera, and store important factors of Player Characters like health, armor class, attack bonuses, conditions, etc, to allow my friends and I to focus on the creative part of Dungeons and Dragons a little easier. 

a snippet of the code can be found in this folder as well
