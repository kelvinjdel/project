Started putting Mugu together, messed up power supply design structure for the motor driver, so I took a break while I focus on Control Systems. 

For now, the power supply was with two coin cell, CR2023 in series via Lilypads to turn on/off, and a TP4056 recharging module, of which I am not too familiar with

I think I need to reassess the datasheet, but I don't think any of the components used in testing were damaged, as the test was a very light 1kHz at "100 speed" arduino test to see how the uno shield would react. at this point, I had to refocus on my Midterm and come back to Mugu on friday


Week 2 update:

I updated the motor shield to use mosfets and have begun circuit analysis on a power supply, but I am likely to use the previous circuit in another project as well for fun.

For now, I have done a good amount of progress designing and building a music box, so I have an 98735a Max I2S amplifier soldered to an ESP8266, 

Currently working on Neovim environment stuff to close out the day. I will get back to working on this tomorrow as well
