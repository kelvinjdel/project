 I'm going to try to play a little with CircuitPython. 
If I can link Qiskit and send information through an MCU
#embedded and IOT, + low  level linux gcc compiler understanding/Rust maybe,
#just going to enjoy the process and get back to this note in the future
#following a youtube channel DIY builder guide for the set up, then look 
#UNO guides, then circuitpython guides, then cook something with I2C/SPI
stuff. I'll draw a schematic later
