# Introduction
- Hey there, I'm Kelvin Jhoer De Leon, a computer engineer and hobbyist looking to use this repository as a way to showcase my technical skills and areas of research I am actively integrating into it as well. 
# Goals
- I hope that these pages serve to showcase my growing interest and understanding in embedded systems, full-stack development, networking, and quantum computing as I look for professional and academic opportunities. I also wish for this to serve as a large source of information for myself in learning different technologies, languages, and concepts.
